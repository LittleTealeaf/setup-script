Simple Linux setup scripts to install applications I use

Install Script:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LittleTealeaf/setup-script/main/install.sh && bash ./install.sh
```

## Scripts Setup
Separate bash files or scripts in both the `scripts` directory and the `customapps` directory are installed while within a temporary folder called `tmp`, which is cleaned after each instance
